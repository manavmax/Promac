# Backend

This folder is reserved for backend services and APIs.

Currently, this project is a frontend-only application. When backend services are added, they will be placed in this directory.

## Future Backend Structure

When backend services are implemented, this folder may contain:

- API routes and controllers
- Database models and migrations
- Authentication and authorization
- Business logic and services
- Configuration files
- Server setup and deployment scripts

## Getting Started

To add backend services:

1. Choose your backend framework (Node.js/Express, Python/Django, etc.)
2. Initialize the backend project in this directory
3. Set up API endpoints
4. Configure database connections
5. Implement authentication if needed
6. Update frontend to consume the new APIs
