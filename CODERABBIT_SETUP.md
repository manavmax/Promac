# CodeRabbit Setup Guide for Promac Electrical

This guide explains how to use CodeRabbit with your React-based electrical component distribution application.

## 🚀 What is CodeRabbit?

CodeRabbit is an AI-powered code review tool that provides intelligent feedback on your pull requests and commits. It analyzes your code for:
- Code quality and best practices
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance optimizations
- Accessibility issues
- React-specific patterns
- JavaScript/TypeScript best practices

## 📋 Prerequisites

- CodeRabbit installed (✅ Already done)
- GitHub repository with push access
- GitHub Actions enabled
- Node.js 18+ (for CI/CD pipeline)

## 🔧 Configuration Files Created

### 1. `.coderabbit.yaml`
This is the main configuration file that tells CodeRabbit how to analyze your code. It includes:
- React-specific checks
- JavaScript/TypeScript optimization
- Tailwind CSS best practices
- Security and performance checks
- Accessibility validation

### 2. `.github/workflows/coderabbit-review.yml`
GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Runs on pull requests and pushes to main/develop branches
- Installs dependencies
- Runs linting and tests
- Triggers CodeRabbit analysis

## 🛠️ Setup Steps

### 1. GitHub Secrets Configuration
You need to add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Add the following secrets:

```
CODERABBIT_TOKEN=your_coderabbit_token_here
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here (usually auto-provided)
```

### 2. Enable CodeRabbit on Your Repository
1. Go to [CodeRabbit Dashboard](https://app.coderabbit.ai)
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Select your `promac_electrical` repository
4. Enable CodeRabbit for the repository

### 3. Configure Branch Protection (Optional but Recommended)
1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Require status checks to pass before merging
4. Include "CodeRabbit Review" in required checks

## 🔍 Example CodeRabbit Feedback

CodeRabbit might provide feedback like:

```javascript
// ❌ Before (CodeRabbit will flag this)
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData().then(setData);
  }, []); // Missing dependency warning
  
  return <div>{data?.name}</div>;
};

// ✅ After (CodeRabbit will suggest this)
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const loadData = async () => {
      try {
        setLoading(true);
        const result = await fetchData();
        setData(result);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };
    
    loadData();
  }, []); // Proper dependency array
  
  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  
  return <div>{data?.name}</div>;
};
```
